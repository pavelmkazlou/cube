"""Root abstract base classes for the ArchiMate 3.2 metamodel.

The four classes defined here form the top of the ArchiMate type hierarchy:

* :class:`Concept` -- the root ABC; all modelling constructs inherit from it.
* :class:`Element` -- an architectural component (active, passive, behaviour).
* :class:`Relationship` -- a directed connection between two Concepts.
* :class:`RelationshipConnector` -- a junction point in relationship chains.

All four are abstract and cannot be instantiated directly.  Concrete
subclasses are defined in later epics (EPIC-003, EPIC-004, EPIC-005).
